SOFTWARE JOURNEY

4-20-2018

Still attempting to create a sustainable workflow. Spent too much time with CHOCOLATEY, CYGWIN, EMACS,
and GIT yesterday. Also, experimented with HUGO, the web template
software.Would like to be able to have everything in a repository,
whether Code, Text, PDF, LatEx, etc.
